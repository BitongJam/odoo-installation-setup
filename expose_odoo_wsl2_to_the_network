# üåê Odoo WSL2 Network Access Setup (Port 2492)

This guide sets up your **Odoo project running inside WSL2** to be accessible from **your Windows host and other devices on your local network**, using **port 2492**.

---

## ‚úÖ Step 1: Edit `odoo.conf` to Listen on All Interfaces

> Edit this inside WSL2 to allow connections from outside WSL.

```ini
[options]
xmlrpc_interface = 0.0.0.0
port = 2492
```

Then restart Odoo inside WSL2:

```bash
./odoo-bin -c /path/to/your/odoo.conf
```

---

## ‚úÖ Step 2: Get Your WSL2 IP Address

Open **PowerShell** in Windows:

```powershell
wsl hostname -I
```

Example output:

```
172.30.39.77
```

Write this IP down ‚Äî it will change after reboot.

---

## ‚úÖ Step 3: Set Port Forwarding from Windows to WSL2

> This command tells Windows to forward traffic on port 2492 to your Odoo running in WSL2.

Open **PowerShell as Administrator**:

```powershell
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 listenport=2492 connectaddress=172.30.39.77 connectport=2492
```

Replace `172.30.39.77` with the IP you got in Step 2.

---

## ‚úÖ Step 4: Allow Port 2492 Through Windows Firewall

Still in **Admin PowerShell**, run:

```powershell
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Odoo 2492 Access" -Direction Inbound -LocalPort 2492 -Protocol TCP -Action Allow
```

Alternatively, you can do this manually:

**Firewall (GUI Method):**

* Go to **Control Panel > Windows Defender Firewall > Advanced Settings**
* Click **Inbound Rules > New Rule**
* Choose **Port > TCP > 2492**
* Allow the connection > Apply to all profiles > Name it `Odoo 2492 Access`

---

## ‚úÖ Step 5: Access Odoo in a Browser

* From **Windows host**:

  ```
  http://localhost:2492
  ```

* From **other devices on the same network**:

  1. Get your Windows IP:

     ```powershell
     ipconfig
     ```

     Look for `IPv4 Address`, e.g., `192.168.1.100`.

  2. Open this in browser on your phone/tablet/etc.:

     ```
     http://192.168.1.100:2492
     ```

---

## üîÅ Step 6: Reconnect After Reboot

WSL2 changes its IP address each time you reboot. You need to:

### 1. Get new WSL2 IP:

```powershell
wsl hostname -I
```

### 2. Remove old port forwarding:

```powershell
netsh interface portproxy delete v4tov4 listenport=2492 listenaddress=0.0.0.0
```

### 3. Add new port forwarding:

```powershell
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 listenport=2492 connectaddress=<new_wsl_ip> connectport=2492
```

---

## üõ† Optional: Automation Script

If you want, you can automate the port forwarding step using this script:

### üîÑ PowerShell Script: `update-odoo-port.ps1`

```powershell
# Get current WSL2 IP
$wslIP = wsl hostname -I | Out-String
$wslIP = $wslIP.Trim()

# Remove old port proxy (safe to do even if it doesn't exist)
netsh interface portproxy delete v4tov4 listenport=2492 listenaddress=0.0.0.0

# Add new port proxy rule
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenaddress=0.0.0.0 listenport=2492 connectaddress=$wslIP connectport=2492

Write-Host "Port 2492 has been forwarded to WSL2 IP $wslIP"
```

To use it:

1. Save it as `update-odoo-port.ps1`
2. Run it **as Administrator** after reboot
3. (Optional) Schedule it with Task Scheduler for automation

---

üìå **You‚Äôre Done!**

Your Odoo running in WSL2 is now accessible from:

* Windows: `http://localhost:2492`
* LAN: `http://<windows-ip>:2492`

Let me know if you want this exported as a `.txt` or `.md` file!
