Absolutely! Hereâ€™s a **step-by-step guide** based on our troubleshooting session, tailored for setting up **Ngrok** with **Odoo** on Ubuntu. This includes the DNS fix that made it all work!

# **Ngrok Setup for Odoo with DNS Fix on Ubuntu**  

## **1. Install Ngrok**  
If you havenâ€™t already, download and install Ngrok:  
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install unzip
curl -s https://ngrok-agent.s3.amazonaws.com/ngrok.asc | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/ngrok.asc >/dev/null
echo "deb https://ngrok-agent.s3.amazonaws.com buster main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ngrok.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ngrok
```

---

## **2. Connect Ngrok to Your Account**  
Sign up at [https://ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com) and get your Auth Token. Then run:  
```bash
ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN_HERE
```

---

## **3. Start Ngrok for Odoo**  
Assuming Odoo runs on **port 7813**, start Ngrok like this:  
```bash
ngrok http http://localhost:7813 --host-header="rewrite" --log=stdout
```

This will provide you with a public HTTPS URL, e.g., `https://xxxx-xxxx.ngrok-free.app`

---

## **4. Fix DNS Resolution Issue**  
To ensure Ngrok URLs resolve correctly, switch to Cloudflare's DNS:  

1. **Edit DNS Configuration**:  
```bash
sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf
```

Replace the contents with:  
```plaintext
#nameserver 127.0.0.53
nameserver 1.1.1.1
nameserver 1.0.0.1
options edns0 trust-ad
search .
```

2. **Flush DNS Cache**:  
```bash
sudo resolvectl flush-caches
```

If that doesnâ€™t work, restart the network manager:  
```bash
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
```

---

## **5. Make DNS Change Permanent**  
Since `/etc/resolv.conf` is dynamically managed by `systemd-resolved`, make the change permanent by disabling it:  
```bash
sudo systemctl disable systemd-resolved.service
sudo systemctl stop systemd-resolved.service
```

Then, recreate a static resolv.conf:  
```bash
sudo rm /etc/resolv.conf
sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf
```

Add the following lines:  
```plaintext
nameserver 1.1.1.1
nameserver 1.0.0.1
```

Finally, restart the network service:  
```bash
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager
```

---

## **6. Test DNS and Ngrok**  
Make sure the Ngrok URL is resolving:  
```bash
nslookup YOUR-NGROK-URL.ngrok-free.app
curl -I https://YOUR-NGROK-URL.ngrok-free.app/
```

You should see a valid **IP address** from `nslookup` and a `200 OK` or `301 Redirect` from `curl`.  

Open the URL in your browser to check if Odoo is loading properly!

---

## **7. (Optional) Configure Odoo for Proxy Support**  
If you encounter redirect loops or HTTPS issues, update Odoo's config:  
```ini
proxy_mode = True
```

And make sure you have this in your Odoo configuration file (usually `odoo.conf`). Then restart Odoo:  
```bash
sudo systemctl restart odoo
```

---

## **8. Troubleshooting Tips**  
- If the URL doesnâ€™t resolve, **clear browser cache** or try in **Incognito mode**.  
- Test on another network (like **mobile data**) to rule out local network restrictions.  
- If still stuck, switch DNS to **Google DNS**:  
```plaintext
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4
```

## **9. Stopping Ngrok**  
To stop the tunnel, simply press `CTRL + C` in the terminal where Ngrok is running.

---

## **Thatâ€™s It! ðŸŽ‰**  
Youâ€™ve now got Ngrok tunneling your Odoo instance securely and reliably! ðŸš€  

Keep this note handy for future projects, or let me know if you need any more help. Happy coding! ðŸ˜Ž
